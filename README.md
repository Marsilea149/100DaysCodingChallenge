# 100 Days Coding Challenge Notes

## Day 1 - 04/12/2021 - Sat
### Reverse a string
Use 2 pointers to be faster, but the time complexity remains O(n).

## Day 2 - 05/12/2021 - Sun
### Clone a graph
Use DFS first traverse to create each node using adjacent list, then traverse back to make sure the adjacent list of the clone graph is complete.

## Day 3 - 06/12/2021 - Mon
### Intersection of two arrays
Use std::map, difficulty: pointer for arrays

## Day 4 - 07/12/2021 -Tu 
### Two sum


## Day 5 - 08/12/2021 - Wed
### Reverse only alphabetical - LeetCode 917 (Easy)
Approach1: use a stack to store the letters. In another loop, pop them to create the string with letters reversed.
Approach2: use a backward pointer, update the pointer when encounter a letter. Use the character of the backward pointer when loop through the input and we encounter a letter.

## Day 6 - 09/12/2021 - Thu
### Linked List Cycle - LeetCode 141 (Easy)

## Day 7 - 10/12/2021 - Fri
### Stack vs Heap
