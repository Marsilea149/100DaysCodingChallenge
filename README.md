# 100 Days Coding Challenge Notes

## Day 1 - 04/12/2021 - Sat
### Reverse a string
Use 2 pointers to be faster, but the time complexity remains O(n).

## Day 2 - 05/12/2021 - Sun
### Clone a graph
Use DFS first traverse to create each node using adjacent list, then traverse back to make sure the adjacent list of the clone graph is complete.
